# AnonymousHound
Mask the trail, keep the scent. AnonymousHound anonymizes sensitive data within BloodHound exports (users, groups, PKI, etc.) ensuring PII is scrubbed, but the full map of security vulnerabilities and attack paths remains 100% intact for analysis.

# AnonymousHound üïµÔ∏èüêï

**Version:** 0.1 ALPHA

## What is this?

AnonymousHound is a PowerShell tool that anonymizes BloodHound data exports, allowing security professionals to safely share Active Directory security assessments without exposing sensitive organizational information.

## Why does this exist?

### The Problem

Imagine you're a security consultant who just completed a comprehensive Active Directory security assessment for a company. You discovered several critical attack paths that could allow an attacker to compromise domain administrator accounts. You want to:

- **Share your findings** with other security researchers to get peer review
- **Create training materials** showing real-world attack scenarios
- **Ask for help** on security forums without exposing your client's identity
- **Demonstrate techniques** at conferences or in blog posts

**BUT** - the BloodHound data contains extremely sensitive information:

- Employee names and usernames (e.g., "john.smith", "sarah.johnson")
- Email addresses (john.smith@acmecorp.com)
- Computer hostnames (FINANCE-PC-01, CEO-LAPTOP)
- Domain names (acmecorp.local, internal.acmecorp.com)
- Organizational structure (Sales OU, Executive OU, IT Department)
- Certificate details and infrastructure layout

**Sharing this data would be a massive privacy and security breach!**

### The Solution

AnonymousHound solves this by **disguising all identifiable information while preserving the attack paths**. Think of it like this:

#### Before Anonymization (Exposed!)
```
User: john.smith@acmecorp.com
  ‚îú‚îÄ MemberOf: Domain Admins
  ‚îú‚îÄ HasSession: FINANCE-PC-01.acmecorp.local
  ‚îî‚îÄ Can compromise: CEO-LAPTOP.acmecorp.local
```

#### After Anonymization (Safe to Share!)
```
User: USR_A3F2E1@domain1.local
  ‚îú‚îÄ MemberOf: Domain Admins  ‚Üê (Preserved! Still shows privilege)
  ‚îú‚îÄ HasSession: HOST_B7D9C2.domain1.local
  ‚îî‚îÄ Can compromise: HOST_F4E8A6.domain1.local
```

**The attack path still exists!** You can still see that:
- A user is a Domain Admin
- That user has a session somewhere
- This creates a path to compromise another computer

But now **all identifying information is gone** - no company names, no employee names, nothing that could trace back to the real organization.

### Real-World Use Cases

#### 1. **Security Research & Collaboration**
*"I found this crazy attack path but I'm not sure if it's exploitable..."*

You can now share your BloodHound data on forums like Reddit's /r/AskNetSec or security Discord servers without violating your NDA or exposing your client.

#### 2. **Training & Education**
*"I want to teach people about Active Directory attacks using real data..."*

Security trainers can use real-world anonymized datasets in courses instead of artificial lab environments, showing students what actual corporate AD environments look like.

#### 3. **Tool Development & Testing**
*"I'm building a tool that analyzes BloodHound data..."*

Developers can test their tools against diverse, real-world datasets without needing access to actual corporate environments.

#### 4. **Conference Presentations & Blog Posts**
*"I want to present my methodology at DEF CON..."*

Security researchers can demonstrate attack techniques and findings publicly without exposing the organizations they assessed.

#### 5. **Compliance & Auditing**
*"We need to show the audit team our security findings..."*

Some compliance frameworks require evidence of security testing, but showing raw data might violate privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA). Anonymized data satisfies both requirements.

## What Gets Anonymized?

### Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- ‚úÖ User names ‚Üí `USR_A3F2E1`
- ‚úÖ Email addresses ‚Üí `email_b7d9c2@domain1.local`
- ‚úÖ Computer names ‚Üí `COMP_F4E8A6`
- ‚úÖ Group names ‚Üí `GRP_C9B2D1`
- ‚úÖ Domain names ‚Üí `DOMAIN1.LOCAL`, `DOMAIN2.LOCAL`
- ‚úÖ Organizational Units ‚Üí `OU_7F3A21`
- ‚úÖ Certificate details ‚Üí Randomized thumbprints
- ‚úÖ Descriptions and display names

### What DOESN'T Get Anonymized? (Critical for Analysis!)
- ‚úÖ **Well-known security principals** (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, Administrators)
- ‚úÖ **Attack path relationships** (MemberOf, HasSession, AdminTo, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Permissions and ACLs** (who can do what to whom)
- ‚úÖ **Group Policy Objects** (attack surface analysis)
- ‚úÖ **Certificate Templates** (AD CS attack paths like ESC1-ESC13)
- ‚úÖ **Domain trust relationships**
- ‚úÖ **Security-relevant properties** (SPN names, encryption types, etc.)

## How It Works (Non-Technical Explanation)

Think of it like a witness protection program for data:

1. **Consistent Identity Replacement**: Every time "john.smith" appears in the data, it becomes "USR_A3F2E1". Same person, new identity, consistent across all files.

2. **Relationship Preservation**: If john.smith was a member of "Domain Admins", then USR_A3F2E1 is still a member of "Domain Admins". The connections remain intact.

3. **Well-Known Protection**: Critical built-in accounts like "Administrator" or "Domain Admins" keep their real names because they're not identifying - every Active Directory has them.

4. **Structure Preservation**: If your company had 5 domains, the anonymized data still has 5 domains. If there were 10 GPOs, there are still 10 GPOs. The structure is identical, just the names have changed.

5. **Idempotent**: Running it twice on the same data doesn't double-anonymize. It recognizes already-anonymized files and skips them.

## Quick Start

### Process an entire BloodHound collection:
```powershell
.\AnonymousHound.ps1 -InputDirectory "C:\BloodHound\Data" -OutputDirectory "C:\BloodHound\Anonymized"
```

### Process a single file:
```powershell
.\AnonymousHound.ps1 -InputFile "C:\BloodHound\users.json" -OutputDirectory "C:\BloodHound\Output"
```

### Randomize timestamps (extra privacy):
```powershell
.\AnonymousHound.ps1 -InputDirectory "C:\BloodHound\Data" -OutputDirectory "C:\BloodHound\Anonymized" -RandomizeTimestamps
```

## What You Get

After running AnonymousHound, you'll get:

1. **Anonymized JSON files** with the `ANONYMIZED_` prefix
2. **A mapping file** showing what was changed (keep this secret!)
3. **Data you can safely share** for research, training, or collaboration

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep the mapping file private!** The `domain_mappings.txt` file shows the translation between real and anonymized names. Don't share this!

‚úÖ **Review before sharing**: While AnonymousHound removes most identifying information, always review the output to ensure nothing sensitive slipped through.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Structural information remains**: While names are hidden, the structure of your Active Directory (number of domains, OUs, users, etc.) is still visible. In rare cases, this might be identifying.

## Example: Before and After

### Before (Sensitive!)
```json
{
  "Properties": {
    "name": "JOHN.SMITH@ACMECORP.COM",
    "samaccountname": "john.smith",
    "email": "john.smith@acmecorp.com",
    "distinguishedname": "CN=John Smith,OU=Sales,OU=Employees,DC=acmecorp,DC=com"
  }
}
```

### After (Safe to Share!)
```json
{
  "Properties": {
    "name": "USR_A3F2E1@DOMAIN1.LOCAL",
    "samaccountname": "USR_A3F2E1",
    "email": "email_b7d9c2@domain1.local",
    "distinguishedname": "CN=CN_F4E8A6,OU=OU_7F3A21,OU=OU_C9B2D1,DC=DOMAIN1,DC=LOCAL"
  }
}
```
